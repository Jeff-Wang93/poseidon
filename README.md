#  We are coding again. After a brief pause we are ready to extend Poseidon. Look for additional refinements to the machine learning, a simpler architecture, and better results. 

# Status
Currently the code is going through a simplification stage.  Many classes are being axed to get things to run in a single docker container.  The code at this point is not functional.

Situational awareness underpins informed decisions. Understanding what comprises a network, and what network elements are doing is essential.  Without situational awareness and context, defending a network remains a difficult proposition.

Can SDN and machine learning answer:
- What devices comprise my network?
- What are devices doing?

# Install Instructions
```
git clone https://github.com/CyberReboot/poseidon.git
cd poseidon
*editor* config/poseidon.config
docker build -f ./Dockerfile -t poseidon .
docker run poseidon
```

# Configuration

## config/poseidon.config
### [Monitor]
rabbit_server =  `RABBIT_SERVER`  
rabbit_port = `RABBIT_PORT`  
collector_nic = `COLLECTOR_NIC`  
vent_ip = `VENT_IP`  
vent_port = `VENT_PORT`  
  
`RABBIT_SERVER` - ip address of the rabbit-mq server   
`RABBIT_PORT` - rabbit-mq server server port  
`COLLECTOR_NIC` - name of the network interface that will be listening for packets  
`VENT_IP` - ip address of serever running vent  
`VENT_PORT` - vent server port  

### [NorthBoundControllerAbstraction:Update_Switch_State]
controller_uri = https://`CONTROLLER_SERVER`:8443/api/v1/  
controller_user = `USERNAME`  
controller_pass = `PASSWORD`  

`CONTROLLER_SERVER` - BCF controller ip  
`USERNAME` - username for BCF login  
`PASSWORD` - password for BCF login
